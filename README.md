# PS2BareMetal

# About

This is a repository with bare metal projects for the Playstation 2 that uses [naken asm](https://github.com/mikeakohn/naken_asm) as assembler, here are projects that I made to learn about how the console works.

# How to compile

You will need the downloaded naked_asm, and configure it in the makefile, and run the compilation command ```make PROJECT_FOLDER=folder``` if you want to compile the "triangle" example, then you should write: ```make PROJECT_FOLDER=triangle```
